# simple_todo_react
A simple ReactJs Todolist project to demonstrate React hooks.
This project touches on the concept od CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) tasks operations. It also marks completed tasks.
The Hooks functions allow for functional components to have a state and use lifecycle methods. This would have normally required
the uses of Classes which would entail a more complex coding.
There is no database use in this project. Hopefully this would be incorporated in a later iteration.
